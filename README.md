## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
### What I learned

I learned how to use media to transform the style depending on the screen size.

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 376px){
    h1{
        font-size: 2em;
    }

    h3{
        font-size: 1.35em
    }

    p{
        font-size: 1em;
        width: 35%;
    }

    .info-box {
        width: 350px;
        height: 245px;
        margin: 0px auto;
    }

    .box-paragraph {
        width: 75%;
    }

    .box-img { 
        bottom: 25px;
        right: 20px;
    }

    .center-box{
        display: inline-block;
        margin: 60px 40px 60px 40px;
    }

    .supervisor-box {
        margin: auto;
        display: inline-block;
        position: relative;
        bottom: 140px;
    }

    .karma-box {
        margin-top: 50px;
    }

    .calculator-box {
        margin: auto;
        display: inline-block;
        position: relative;
        bottom: 140px;
    }

}
```


### Continued development

Need more practise on responsive web design.

### Useful resources
